This documentation assumes you have an nvidia graphics card. We have tested
on Ubuntu 14.04, Debian Stable 7.6, and Fedora 20.

WHAT SETUP IS REQUIRED?

  * Appropriate permissions for Oculus hidraw devices. See
    LibOVR/90-oculus.rules and ConfigurePermissionsAndPackages.sh .
  * Use a non-rotated twinview setup or place the rift on a separate 
    non-rotated X screen.
  * Ensure oculusd is running when using the rift.

BUILD INSTRUCTIONS

  After installing the appropriate packages simply issue 'make' in the root of
  the SDK directory. This will build a release version of Oculus World Demo
  (OWD). To generate debug symbols use 'make DEBUG=1'.

HOW DO I RUN OCULUS WORLD DEMO (OWD)?

  Either run the binary directly from the output directory, or use 'make run'.

SHOULD I ROTATE MY DEVICE'S SCREEN?

  Manual screen rotation is not recommend. If your window is fullscreen on a
  rift device, set the ovrDistortionCap_LinuxDevFullscreen distortion cap to
  have the SDK automatically rotate the distortion mesh on appropriate devices.
  Be aware you will have to account for window size. You can use
  OVR::SDKWindow::findDevScreenForHMD (Displays/OVR_Linux_SDKWindow.h) to
  return the screen offset and dimensions necessary to size your Linux window.
  See Samples/CommonSrc/Platform/Linux_Platform.cpp for an example.

SEPARATE X SCREEN

  ConfigUtil will not currently work across X screens. You will need
  to use TwinView to use ConfigUtil.

TWINVIEW

  You must sync to the Rift's display device for a smooth experience when using
  twinview. To consistently sync to the rift with Twinview setups, set the
  __GL_SYNC_DISPLAY_DEVICE environment variable to the appropriate display
  device before X starts. For example in your /etc/profile you could place the
  following:

    export __GL_SYNC_DISPLAY_DEVICE="DFP-1"

  if you're rift corresponds to DFP-1.

STARTING THE TRACKING SERVICE AUTOMATICALLY

  Start the tracking service when a user is logged in using Xsession files.

UBUNTU USERS

  There was a kernel bug which affected HID devices in 14.04. If you find you
  are receiving feature report failures, please upgrade your distro as the
  bug is now fixed.
